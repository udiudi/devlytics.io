# DevLytics.io

Devlytics was a team productivty and analytics tool. It was active for over 2 years, and helped team members and managers to understand the problematic areas in the codebase, the performance of the team and where you may have possible issues and how you should solve them.
<br /><br />
It helped you understand what areas in the code slows the development, who should be paired with whom in order to transfer some knowledge, and what areas need more attention in a form of testing and refactoring.
<br /><br />
Over the years, GitHub and service alike developed more and more of DevLytics' core functionality, and we decided to shut it down and move to other ventures, since competing with awesome platforms is too difficult for us :)

We want to thank everyone who found our tool useful :heart:
